# Workday-Scheduler

## Description
This webpage implemented Day.js, jQuery and the users local storage to provide a daily schedule planner.  Upon opening the webpage, the current day is inserted at the top of the schedule.  When the user scrolls down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours. Each individual time block is then evaluated against the users current time and its color is dynamically changed.  The time blocks are displayed in grey if in the past, red if present/current time, and green if in the future. When the user clicks into a time block, they are able to input an event and click the save button which pushes the input data to their local storage.  If the user refreshes their page, the events are still available within the time blocks.
